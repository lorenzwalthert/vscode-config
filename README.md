*This is experimental, bug reports and fixes welcome.*

This repo contains various VS code files I use in my vs code config.

Highlights:

* RStudio-like REPL configuration for `.py` files: Cmd+Enter behavior is
  replicated for Python and works for current line and selected code in the
  editor and outside of the debugger. These are defined in 
  `keybindings.json` and some of them have dependencies on `settings.json`, 
  as they are implemented as macros.
