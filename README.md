*This is experimental, bug reports and fixes welcome.*

This repo contains various VS code files I use in my vs code config.

Highlights:

* RStudio-like REPL configuration for the Cmd+Enter command for `.py` files.
  That is, run current line or selected code in terminal or debugger console
  **and** move the cursor one line down. These are defined in `keybindings.json`
  and some of them have dependencies on `settings.json`, as they are implemented
  as macros.
